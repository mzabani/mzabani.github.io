<p>Many of us are familiar with the typical transactional isolation
levels in relation databases. Read-committed, Repeatable-Read and
Serializable are examples. And there are many articles and sources
listing the undesirable phenomena some of these isolation levels protect
us from, like dirty reads, phantom reads and serialization
anomalies.</p>
<p>One also finds phrases like serializable transactions are “guaranteed
to produce the same effect as running them one at a time in some order”,
but what kind of strangeness might arise from not running as such? There
are also Stack Overflow answers suggesting accounting and enforcing
credit limits is an example where serializability is important, but what
does that <em>really</em> mean? PostgreSQL’s <a
href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html">docs</a>
say that “a read-only transaction at this level may see a control record
updated to show that a batch has been completed but not see one of the
detail records which is logically part of the batch because it read an
earlier revision of the control record”, but what does that
<em>really</em> mean?</p>
<p>Most sources I’ve found lack two very important things: an intuition
around the kinds of failures that might arise with isolation less than
Serializable, e.g. Repeatable-Read, and examples.</p>
<p>So I’ll show you two such examples. They’re not mine, they’re from
the paper that introduced the current Serializable isolation’s
implementation in PostgreSQL <a
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.4179">1</a>. So big thanks to Kevin
Grittner and Dan Ports. In fact, this blog post is mostly a copy of
their paper, it’s just shortened quite a bit and focused on the
examples. So all credit goes to those guys. Read the paper if you want
more details.</p>
<p>From those examples we <em>hope</em> to build a slightly better
intuition around serialization anomalies, but I actually hope to
convince you, the reader, that anything less than Serializable isolation
- including Repeatable-Read - is tantamount to a level where humans
cannot reason about correctness, and implications can be dire.</p>
<p>Before the examples, we shall take a quick closer look at
Repeatable-Read.</p>
<h3 id="repeatable-read">Repeatable-Read</h3>
<p>Repeatable-Read ensures inside your transaction you do not see
<em>any</em> effects of other concurrent transactions, whether they’ve
committed, aborted or are still running. You get a <em>snapshot</em> of
the database when you <code>BEGIN</code> your transaction and work with
that until you commit.</p>
<p>Also, two concurrent transactions cannot modify the same row under
Repeatable-Read.</p>
<p>It sounds pretty robust. How can this go wrong? Let’s look at
examples.</p>
<h3 id="first-example-doctors-on-call">First example: doctors on
call</h3>
<p>Suppose you manage a hospital and you you must always have at least
one doctor on call at any one time. Bob, Alice and Joe are your doctors,
and initially Alice and Joe are on call but Bob isn’t.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode sql"><code class="sourceCode sql"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">CREATE</span> <span class="kw">TABLE</span> doctors (<span class="kw">id</span> SERIAL <span class="kw">PRIMARY</span> <span class="kw">KEY</span>, name text, oncall BOOL);</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">INSERT</span> <span class="kw">INTO</span> doctors (name, oncall) <span class="kw">VALUES</span> (<span class="st">&#39;Alice&#39;</span>, <span class="kw">TRUE</span>), (<span class="st">&#39;Joe&#39;</span>, <span class="kw">TRUE</span>), (<span class="st">&#39;Bob&#39;</span>, <span class="kw">FALSE</span>);</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now you write the endpoint that takes a doctor off call (in some
pseudo-code):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode sql"><code class="sourceCode sql"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="kw">SELECT</span> <span class="fu">COUNT</span>(<span class="op">*</span>) <span class="kw">FROM</span> doctors <span class="kw">WHERE</span> oncall;</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> x <span class="op">&gt;=</span> <span class="dv">2</span> <span class="cf">then</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="kw">UPDATE</span> doctors <span class="kw">SET</span> oncall<span class="op">=</span><span class="kw">false</span> <span class="kw">WHERE</span> name <span class="op">=</span> {DOCTORNAMEHERE};</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">else</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  RAISE <span class="st">&#39;This would leave no doctors on call&#39;</span>;</span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">end</span> <span class="cf">if</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Before continuing, take a minute to look at the code above: it looks
right. It would probably pass review in most places. It’s the code I
would write, but also most people I know. Or it’s similar to that.</p>
<p>Suppose users call your endpoint twice for ‘Alice’ and for ‘Joe’, and
the transactions run concurrently. Even with Repeatable-Read isolation
level, both transactions will run and commit successfully, and at the
end you will have 0 (zero) doctors on call. This is of course very
different from what would happen if you ran two transactions <em>one
after the other/sequentially</em>, so it’s a perfect example of a
serialization anomaly.</p>
<p>With Serializable isolation one of the two transactions would fail
with:</p>
<pre><code>ERROR:  could not serialize access due to read/write dependencies among transactions</code></pre>
<p>And the hospital would be in good hands. This is the first example of
where Repeatable-Read fails: when concurrent transactions read the same
data but write to different places.</p>
<h3 id="second-example-receipts-and-batches">Second example: receipts
and batches</h3>
<p>Also from Grittner’s and Ports’s paper, imagine you have a table of
receipts that are each associated with a batch number, and another table
with just one row storing the current batch number. Then you have 3
operations, copied verbatim from the referenced paper below:</p>
<ul>
<li>NEW-RECEIPT: reads the current batch number from the control table,
then inserts a new entry in the receipts table tagged with that batch
number</li>
<li>CLOSE-BATCH: increments the current batch number in the control
table</li>
<li>REPORT: reads the current batch number from the control table, then
reads all entries from the receipts table with the previous batch number
(i.e. to display a total of the previous day’s receipts)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s create these tables with the current batch starting as
<code>1</code> and one receipt in it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode sql"><code class="sourceCode sql"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">CREATE</span> <span class="kw">TABLE</span> current_batch (batch <span class="dt">INT</span>);</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">INSERT</span> <span class="kw">INTO</span> current_batch <span class="kw">VALUES</span> (<span class="dv">1</span>);</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">CREATE</span> <span class="kw">TABLE</span> receipts (<span class="kw">id</span> SERIAL <span class="kw">PRIMARY</span> <span class="kw">KEY</span>, batch <span class="dt">INT</span>, amount <span class="dt">INT</span>);</span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">INSERT</span> <span class="kw">INTO</span> receipts (batch, amount) <span class="kw">VALUES</span> (<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">100</span>);</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s look at one particular transaction first, the
<code>REPORT</code> one:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre
class="sourceCode sql"><code class="sourceCode sql"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>current_batch <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="kw">SELECT</span> batch <span class="kw">FROM</span> current_batch;</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">SELECT</span> <span class="fu">SUM</span>(amount) <span class="kw">FROM</span> receipts <span class="kw">WHERE</span> batch<span class="op">=</span>current_batch<span class="op">-</span><span class="dv">1</span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Again I will ask you to read this and think for a minute. This looks
right, doesn’t it? Can you think of what problems might arise from this
under Repeatable-Read isolation?</p>
<p>The answer is: <strong>it can report the sum of a batch that might
still have receipts added to it.</strong> I am not kidding. Let me show
you:</p>
<p>Suppose 3 transactions run concurrently in Repeatable-Read mode, each
with one of the 3 kinds of transactions, and their execution is
interleaved as such:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
Transaction 1 (REPORT)
</td>
<td>
Transaction 2 (NEW-RECEIPT)
</td>
<td>
Transaction 3 (CLOSE-BATCH)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td>
<code>BEGIN ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;       current_batch &lt;- SELECT batch FROM current_batch;</code>
</td>
<td>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td>
</td>
<td>
<code>BEGIN ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;       UPDATE current_batch SET batch=batch+1;       COMMIT;</code>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<code>BEGIN ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;       current_batch &lt;- SELECT batch FROM current_batch;           SELECT SUM(amount) FROM receipts WHERE batch=current_batch-1;           COMMIT;</code>
</td>
<td>
</td>
<td>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td>
<code>INSERT INTO receipts (batch, amount) VALUES (current_batch, 1000);       COMMIT;</code>
</td>
<td>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>After the execution above, the transaction in the middle will insert
a receipt with amount=1000 into batch 1, but the first transaction
(REPORT) will have shown a total of 100 for that batch.</p>
<p>Another thing that is really hard to see is that this requires all 3
transactions to run concurrently to run into this odd behaviour, and
that <code>REPORT</code> is read-only. And once again, using
Serializable isolation would make transactions fail to keep this from
happening.</p>
<p>The broad picture is that serialization anomalies come to be due to a
cycle of rw-conflicts (a rw-conflict is a Read by one transaction whose
results would be affected by a concurrent transaction’s Writes; more
details in the referenced paper), but this is of course not helpful for
an intuition or smaller mental model. So I have no intuition to offer
the reader for this example.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>Hopefully I’ve achieved my goal: unless you’re truly one of a kind (I
tend to be careful with my wording, but I’m going to take the liberty of
speaking plainly: you’re not; I am not; no human is), you cannot reason
about what might happen in a system that’s not running with Serializable
isolation. And very strange/bad things can happen. We covered an example
with 2 transactions and another with 3, but real systems have tens,
hundreds, thousands of them. Can you comfortably say no concurrent
execution of transactions will have an undesirable effect?</p>
<p>Hopefully I’ll find time to write about some limitations of
PostgreSQL’s current implementation of Serializable isolation next
time.</p>
